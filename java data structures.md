give me a brief comparison between java 8 data structures

## AI Assistant
Certainly! Here's a brief overview of Java 8's key data structures and their comparison:

---

### Lists:
- **ArrayList**
    - **Implementation:** Uses a resizable array.
    - **Performance:** Fast random access (`O(1)`), slower insert/delete operations (`O(n)`).
- **LinkedList**
    - **Implementation:** Doubly linked list.
    - **Performance:** Slow random access (`O(n)`), better performance for insert/delete (`O(1)` at ends, `O(n)` elsewhere).

---

### Sets:
- **HashSet**
    - **Implementation:** Based on HashMap.
    - **Storage:** Unordered, simply stores unique elements.
    - **Performance:** Offers constant-time performance (`O(1)`) for retrieval operations (average case).
- **LinkedHashSet**
    - **Implementation:** Hash table + linked list.
    - **Storage:** Maintains insertion order.
    - **Performance:** Slightly slower than HashSet due to ordering overhead (`O(1)` average-case insert/search).
- **TreeSet**
    - **Implementation:** Balanced Tree (Red-Black tree).
    - **Storage:** Sorted in natural or defined order.
    - **Performance:** Slower than HashSet for add/search (`O(log n)`), but provides ordered storage.

---

### Maps:
- **HashMap**
    - **Implementation:** Hash-based data structure.
    - **Storage:** Unordered key-value storage.
    - **Performance:** Fast access (`O(1)` average-case complexity).
- **LinkedHashMap**
    - **Implementation:** Hash table + doubly linked list.
    - **Storage:** Maintains insertion/access order.
    - **Performance:** Slightly slower than HashMap (`O(1)` average-case complexity).
- **TreeMap**
    - **Implementation:** Balanced Tree (Red-Black tree).
    - **Storage:** Sorted by natural or defined comparator.
    - **Performance:** Access operations slower (`O(log n)`) but provides ordered storage.

---

### Queues:
- **PriorityQueue**
    - **Implementation:** Heap-based queue.
    - **Storage:** Elements ordered according to comparator or natural ordering.
    - **Performance:** Offers quick access to the smallest/largest element (`O(log n)` for add/remove, `O(1)` peek).
- **ArrayDeque**
    - **Implementation:** Resizable circular array.
    - **Storage:** Allows insertion/deletion at both ends, performant for stack or queue operations.
    - **Performance:** Efficient: operations are typically constant-time (`O(1)`).

---

### Special Purpose Structures:
- **ConcurrentHashMap**
    - **Implementation:** Thread-safe hash table with segmented locking.
    - **Use Case:** Concurrency scenarios, providing better scalability than synchronized collections.
- **CopyOnWriteArrayList/CopyOnWriteArraySet**
    - **Implementation:** Creates a fresh copy on modifications.
    - **Use Case:** Offers thread safety with expensive writes (`O(n)`), but cheap reads (`O(1)`), suitable for collections with minimal updates.

### Points on Thread Safety:

- **Non-thread-safe collections:** `ArrayList`, `LinkedList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, `PriorityQueue`, `ArrayDeque`, and `LinkedHashMap` require external synchronization (use `Collections.synchronizedX()` if synchronization is needed).
- **Thread-safe legacy collections:** `Vector`, `Hashtable` (now rarely used, prefer concurrent collections).
- **Thread-safe concurrent collections:** `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList`, and `CopyOnWriteArraySet` are optimized for multi-threaded environments, offering high concurrency performance.
