## Brief Overview of Core Java Concepts:
### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Java follows the OOP paradigm using Classes and Objects.
- Key principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism.

### 2. **Classes and Objects**
- **Classes** are templates/blueprints for creating **Objects**.
- **Objects** are instances of classes, holding state (attributes) and behavior (methods).

### 3. **Inheritance**
- Allows classes (subclass) to inherit fields/methods from another class (superclass).
- Supports code reusability and method overriding.

### 4. **Polymorphism**
- Allows methods/objects to exist in multiple forms.
- Implemented through method overriding (runtime polymorphism) and method overloading (compile-time polymorphism).

### 5. **Encapsulation**
- Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).
- Controls data access via access modifiers (`public`, `protected`, `private`, default/package-private).

### 6. **Abstraction**
- Provides simplified, relevant view (contract behavior) hiding complex implementation.
- Implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.

### 7. **Interfaces**
- Defines contracts by containing abstract methods (method signatures without implementation).
- Allows Java 8+ default and static methods with implementations.

### 8. **Exception Handling**
- Ensures graceful handling of runtime errors using `try-catch-finally` blocks.
- Checked (`Exception`) and unchecked (`RuntimeException`) exceptions in Java.

### 9. **Generics**
- Enables type-safe classes/methods by parameterizing data types, enhancing type safety and readability.

### 10. **Collections Framework**
- Offers data structures (List, Set, Map, Queue) for easier data management and manipulation.

### 11. **Multithreading**
- Java provides built-in thread support, offering concurrency and parallelism through Threads, Executors, and Runnable interfaces.

### 12. **Java Streams (Java 8+)**
- Provides fluent functional-style operations (`Stream API`) allowing easier collection processing with methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`.

## Comparison Table of Main Java Concepts:

| Java Concept | Purpose | Main Benefits | Example Keywords/Structures |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Classes** | Blueprint for objects | Structure, reusability, definition of data & behavior | `class`, constructors, methods, fields |
| **Objects** | Real-world representation of classes | Hold state & behavior | `new`, instance variables/methods |
| **Inheritance** | Reuse and extend functionality | Reusability, hierarchy, overriding | `extends`, superclass, subclass |
| **Polymorphism** | Methods performing different tasks | Flexibility, dynamic method dispatch, simplified code | Method overriding/overloading |
| **Encapsulation** | Data protection and structuring | Security, integrity, maintainability | Access modifiers (`private`, `protected`, `public`) |
| **Abstraction** | Simplify complexity | Reduces complexity and dependencies, design simplicity | Abstract classes, Interfaces |
| **Interfaces** | Define contracts without implementations | Loose coupling, flexible designs | `interface`, `implements`, defaults, static methods |
| **Exception Handling** | Manage runtime and checked errors | Robustness, predictable errors | `try`, `catch`, `finally`, throws |
| **Generics** | Allow generalized type-safe programming | Reusability, Type-safety, avoid casting issues | `<T>`, `List<T>`, `Map<K,V>` |
| **Collections** | Data structures library | Storage, searching, sorting, traversal | `List`, `Set`, `Map`, `Queue`, Collections API |
| **Multithreading** | Concurrency, running tasks simultaneously | Performance, responsiveness, parallel execution | `Thread`, `Runnable`, Executors |
| **Java Streams** | Operations on data streams (Java 8+) | Readable, concise, functional-style, parallelization | Lambda expressions, stream API (`map/filter`) |
